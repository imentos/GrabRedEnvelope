# Privacy Policy for Grab Red Envelope

**Last Updated:** February 19, 2026

## Introduction

This privacy policy explains how Grab Red Envelope ("the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Summary

**Grab Red Envelope does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

## Data Collection

We do not collect any personal information or data from users of the App. This includes but is not limited to:

- ❌ No names or contact information
- ❌ No email addresses or phone numbers
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No device identifiers
- ❌ No usage analytics or statistics
- ❌ No photos or media files
- ❌ No browsing history or app activity
- ❌ No gameplay data or scores (everything stays on your device)

## SharePlay Integration

The App uses Apple's SharePlay framework to enable multiplayer functionality over FaceTime. Here's how it works:

### What SharePlay Does
- Synchronizes game state between participants in a FaceTime call
- Transmits game events (envelope grabs, scores) peer-to-peer
- All data transmission is handled directly by Apple's GroupActivities framework

### What We Don't Have Access To
- We do NOT see or store any SharePlay session data
- We do NOT have access to your FaceTime calls
- We do NOT know who you play with or when you play
- All game data exists only during the active session and is deleted when the game ends

### Apple's Privacy
SharePlay uses end-to-end encryption through Apple's secure infrastructure. For more information about SharePlay privacy, please see [Apple's SharePlay Privacy Information](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/shareplay-iph73565d573/ios).

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services, including:

- ❌ No analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No crash reporting tools
- ❌ No social media integrations
- ❌ No authentication services

## Network Communication

The only network communication the App performs is:

- ✅ Peer-to-peer game synchronization via Apple SharePlay (encrypted by Apple)
- ✅ FaceTime call facilitation (handled by iOS, not by our app)

We do not operate any servers, databases, or backend infrastructure.

## Children's Privacy

Our App is designed to be safe for users of all ages, including children. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

**Age Rating:** 4+ (Safe for all ages)

Because we do not collect any data from any users, we do not collect any data from children under 13 (or any other age).

## Data Storage

Since we don't collect any data, we don't store any data. Your gameplay experience is:

- **Local Only:** All game state exists temporarily in device memory during active gameplay
- **Session-Based:** Game data is automatically deleted when you close the app or end the SharePlay session
- **No History:** We do not save game history, scores, or any other information

## Your Privacy Rights

Because we don't collect any personal data, there is no data to:

- Access
- Modify
- Delete
- Export
- Port to another service

You have complete control because nothing leaves your device except temporary game synchronization data during active SharePlay sessions.

## Permissions

The App requests the following iOS permissions:

### Required Permissions
- **GroupActivities (SharePlay):** Required for multiplayer functionality
  - Used only when you explicitly start a SharePlay session
  - No data is stored or transmitted outside of active game sessions

### Permissions We Do NOT Request
- ❌ Camera or Photo Library
- ❌ Microphone (FaceTime handles this separately)
- ❌ Location Services
- ❌ Contacts
- ❌ Health Data
- ❌ Bluetooth
- ❌ Calendar or Reminders
- ❌ Notifications (optional, iOS handles internally)

## Cookies and Tracking

The App does not use:

- ❌ Cookies
- ❌ Tracking pixels
- ❌ Advertising identifiers
- ❌ Cross-site tracking
- ❌ Device fingerprinting
- ❌ Any other tracking technologies

## Data Security

Since we don't collect or store any data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information through our App.

SharePlay data transmitted during gameplay is secured by Apple's end-to-end encryption and peer-to-peer architecture.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. We will not reduce your privacy protections without your explicit consent.

If we make changes, we will:
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document
